                <p>The HUGODECA single cell viewer is a database for the visualization, mining and comparison of published omics data sets for the reproductive science community.
                    It was developed to assist scientists in the mining of a wide range of ultra-high-throughput reprogenomics data, including RNA and DNA sequencing data.
                    Data sets are curated, processed and conveniently organized into several categories including biological topics, technologies, species and publications.
                    These standardized data analysis procedures within the reproductive science community greatly facilitate comparisons of data sets.</p>

                <h2>Why should I submit my highthroughput data to the ReproGenomics Viewer?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Considerable worries have recently been raised regarding the lack of reproducibility of biomedical research.
                    Funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), share this concern and discuss ways to enhance reproducibility by notably providing greater transparency of the data.
                    Journals and public funding agencies have thus begun to make public availability of raw data but also analyzed data a condition of publication or funding, respectively.<br>
                    In addition, we believe that it is also a matter of give and take, so to speak as making reprogenomics data available to the community:<br>
                    1- it will facilitate data comparison and the development of innovative tools;<br>
                    2- and, on the other hand, it will make your reprogenomics studies and publications more visible (as investigators will be able to compare their own data with yours) and it will thus boost citations of your scientific articles.</p>
